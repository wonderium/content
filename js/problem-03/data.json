  "content": "The issue in JavaScript caused by the representation of floating-point numbers in binary. Numbers like '0.1' and '0.2' cannot be represented exactly in binary, leading to small rounding errors during calculations. For example, '0.1 + 0.2' results in '0.30000000000000004' instead of '0.3'. This problem can be mitigated by using techniques such as rounding to a fixed number of decimal places or working with libraries that support arbitrary-precision arithmetic.",
