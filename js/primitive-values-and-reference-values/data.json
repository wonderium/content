  "content": "The primitive values are immutable and include types, such as `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol` and `bigint`. The reference values, on the other hand, are objects, arrays and functions. Unlike primitives, reference values are mutable and compared by reference, not by value.",
